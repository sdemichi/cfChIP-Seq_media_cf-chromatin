# cfChIP-Seq_media_cf-chromatin
This is the project directory for one of the projects I've worked on in my PhD, titled "Simulating cell-free chromatin using preclinical models for cancer-specific biomarker discovery" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.16.567416). The scripts in this repo were for analyses involving the profiling of euchromatin and heterochromatin modifications (using cell-free ChIP-Seq) in circulating cell-free chromatin from preclinical models.
